This project is developed as part of an assignment using the CodeIgniter 4 framework. The main objective of the project is to implement a backend system with user authentication and teacher management modules. The system is fully database-driven and uses MySQL for persistent storage. It is designed to demonstrate backend development concepts including MVC architecture, authentication, database handling, and project setup.

The application is built using PHP 8+ with CodeIgniter 4. Composer is used for dependency management and phpMyAdmin is used to manage the database. The project has been structured in the standard format provided by CodeIgniter, which separates the application logic, configuration, and public-facing files. This ensures clean code organization and scalability.

The project provides two main modules. The first module is the authentication system, where users can register and manage their accounts. User details such as email, first name, last name, password, and account creation time are stored in the database. The second module is the teacher management system, which links teacher profiles to registered users. Each teacher record stores details such as the associated user, university name, gender, and the year the teacher joined. The relationship between users and teachers is maintained through foreign keys in the database, ensuring data consistency.

The database has been designed with two tables: auth_user and teachers. The auth_user table contains information related to users, while the teachers table stores details about teachers and references the auth_user table through a foreign key relationship. A database export file is provided in the repository so that the schema can be imported directly without manually creating the tables.

To run the project, first clone the repository from GitHub. Once inside the project folder, install the dependencies using Composer. Next, set up the database in MySQL by creating a database (for example, ci_project) and importing the provided SQL file from the database folder. After the database has been imported, the environment configuration file (.env) needs to be updated with the correct database connection details such as hostname, database name, username, password, and driver.

After the database and configuration have been set up, the project can be started using the built-in CodeIgniter command. Running php spark serve will start the local development server, and the project can then be accessed in the browser at http://localhost:8080. The application will load from the public directory, which serves as the entry point for the system.

The project repository has been structured into several important folders. The app folder contains the main application logic, including controllers, models, and views. The public folder contains the public entry point (index.php) and can also hold assets like CSS and JavaScript. The writable folder stores logs and cached files, while the tests folder includes PHPUnit test files. A database folder has been added to include the SQL export file so that the database can be quickly set up. The repository also contains the composer.json file for dependencies, the .env file for environment variables, and the spark CLI tool for running CodeIgniter commands.

This project demonstrates the use of CodeIgniter for backend development and provides a simple but effective example of how to implement authentication and teacher management with database support. The repository includes both the source code and the database export file, along with setup instructions in this README. This ensures that the evaluator can easily clone the repository, set up the environment, and run the project without additional configuration.

The solution is submitted through this GitHub repository as required. The project contains clear instructions, a database export file, and a functional backend implementation. The UI can be extended creatively on top of this backend if needed.
